You should exemplify the :muscle: best work you can do with the provided example and perhaps :boom: surprise us.

You are expected to give, a technical feedback to the project as if it's a real life project in code review format. 

## Procedure

1. You should fork this repo as **private** repository
2. You should do your :sparkles: work
3. You should open up a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) at your **own** forked version of the repository.
4. You will received feedback for this PR which you are supposed to address during the on-site interview

> You will have to [add](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) the hiring manager or the reviewers as collaborators to your created repository

## Introduction

JSON is parsed manually and elements has been created from the parsed data. 

All the logical operations are happening in `MyNewsActivity.kt` file and all the visual creation for the list items is happening in `news_item.xml` file. 
There is only one data class for `News` element and it's in model folder.

Application is written in Kotlin.

You are free to suggest any library or code snippet that you think that is going to be useful for the codebase. 
But please be sure add detailed information about your suggestions and why would they be useful. 

## Questions

You can open an [issue](https://github.com/motain/android_take_home_test/issues) if you have any troubles.
